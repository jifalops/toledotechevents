/// [Color] and [ColorSwatch] constants which represent Material design's
/// [color palette](http://material.google.com/style/color.html).
///
/// Instead of using an absolute color from these palettes, consider using
/// [Theme.of] to obtain the local [ThemeData] structure, which exposes the
/// colors selected for the current theme, such as [ThemeData.primaryColor] and
/// [ThemeData.accentColor] (among many others).
///
/// Most swatches have colors from 100 to 900 in increments of one hundred, plus
/// the color 50. The smaller the number, the more pale the color. The greater
/// the number, the darker the color. The accent swatches (e.g. [redAccent]) only
/// have the values 100, 200, 400, and 700.
///
/// In addition, a series of blacks and whites with common opacities are
/// available. For example, [black54] is a pure black with 54% opacity.
///
/// ## Sample code
///
/// To select a specific color from one of the swatches, index into the swatch
/// using an integer for the specific color desired, as follows:
///
/// ```dart
/// Color selection = Colors.green[400]; // Selects a mid-range green.
/// ```
///
/// Each [ColorSwatch] constant is a color and can used directly. For example:
///
/// ```dart
/// new Container(
///   color: Colors.blue, // same as Colors.blue[500] or Colors.blue.shade500
/// )
/// ```
